As apart of my Eurorail traveling I did a day trip city walk through the Principality of Monaco. It's unbelievable how small the country really is. You can mistakenly cross the border by just doing a relaxed walk! It gives you the feeling of downtown Dubai but with mountains in the surroundings and significantly better weather. 

### As your wee walk begins!
For those lazy asses! It's not hard to spot escalators to help gain your step count.

### But don't go to high you could be an illegal alien in another country
I am going to make you guess where monaco ends! (hint: Not the part that has British inspired roads). While walking if you notice a change in the environment, feeling deserted you have probably left Monaco.

### As you decent back down 
Do enjoy the beautiful blue sea and it's definitely worth heading in-person. You will
see a lot of rich people. Don't worry so long as the plastic is on their body and not on the sea it's good for everyone!

### It's hard to miss this
You cannot mention you have gone to Monaco without spotting a fancy car with the view of the city! The policing was amazing, even with fancy cars the road discipline was fantastic.

### Do not miss walking into tunnels 
The principality is so small that below the city is basically car parks and tunnels. The car city planning is amazing even-though I hate car based cities.

### The beauty of the principality as a whole
The entire city is stunning you can admire the real beauty as you head towards the sea. If you have head phones I recommend listening to the Album "Death of a Bachelor" by Panic! At The Disco while walking around.

### I would never understand why would anyone buy a yacht! 
It's a boat that is really slow. I would rather buy more lego!
