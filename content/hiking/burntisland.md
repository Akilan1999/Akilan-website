## Walk description
A really easy and relaxed walk. Can be easily done no matter the weather condition.
From the previous hikes done so far one of the most well connected hikes especially from the Edinburgh side.

### Key highlights 
- Really cute train station.
- You can easily unleash the kid in yourself by adoring the cute trains and [4 legged wingman](https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/cutest-dog-breed-german-shephard-6435743c5766b.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.836xh;0,0.141xh&resize=980:*) along the walkway.
- Fancy houses blocking pathways which should be public.

This was taken from the highest peak and shows
a impressive view of the small town with Edinburgh across the sea. North bridge is barely visible due 
to the clouds.

While walking through the trail we intended to take 
a deviation to walk through the Fife costal walkway 
to walk closer to the sea. There is a small caveat 
that the segment of costal walkway can only be traversed 
on a low tide (Unless you are [Moses](https://i.pinimg.com/474x/e5/fb/3e/e5fb3eb00e8a5c2566f571fdde2e0385.jpg)).
The annoying part was that there was a relatively high tide which we didn't notice blocking parts of the path. The worst case scenario would be to walk back to the start of the costal path and walk along side the road to city centre. The picture above reflects one of the deviated paths we could have taken but unfortunately private property had fenced out path way from the public from using it (This was a bit frustrating). When walking through the partially blocked pathway a nice view of the sea could be captured.

Rocky parts which had to be crossed through the costal walkway.

Start of the costal walkway from the fancy golf course. Crossing the golf course is part of the trail. Heading 
to the beach is not part of the documented path on the trail provided in [Walkhighlands](https://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/fife-stirling/the-binn-burntisland.shtm).
