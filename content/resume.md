## Experience

### 1. Maintainer
#### [P2PRC](http://github.com/Akilan1999/p2p-rendering-computation)
Maintainer of a project I created and currently developing. P2PRC is a p2p network designed to orchestrate custom tasks on a P2P network. The project is built entirely using Go Lang. 
##### Languages used:
Go, Haskell, Python
#### Derived from P2PRC:
- Open source self hosted version for remote gaming using WebRTC: https://github.com/Akilan1999/remotegameplay


### 2. Core Developer 
#### [Peernet](https://github.com/PeernetOfficial)
October 2021 - November 2023, Remote (Prague, Czechia)

Worked on the open source project (https://github.com/PeernetOfficial/core).
##### Languages used:
- Go, JS, Kotlin

### 3. Senior Software Engineer 
#### [Maman LLC](https://maman.ae)
August 2021 - March 2022, Remote (Dubai, UAE)

Worked on Read Solomon error corrections for finger printing audio signals and 
worked with Maman with smaller consultancy work. 

##### Languages used:
- Go, Python


### 4. Senior Software Engineer 
#### [Karaz](https://apps.apple.com/tt/app/karaz-platform-%D9%83%D8%B1%D8%B2/id1576524708)
September 2021 - Present, Remote (Riyadh, Saudi Arabia)

Took over the Karaz back end development as apart of mutual agreement to switch over from 
Maman to Karaz. Initially built the entire back-end system for Karaz which included reverse
engineering glucose devices and extracting data from such devices. As the company grew recruited
back-end developers to do most of the maintenance and feature building. 

##### Languages used:
Go, Python, Javascript, Kotlin, Java

### 5. Software Engineer Intern 
#### [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/)
August 2020 - March 2021, Remote (San Francisco, California, United States)

Working on an open source project to benchmark the project Vitess (A database clustering system for horizontal scaling of MySQL).

Project: [Vitess Arewefastyet](/projects/arewefastyet/)

### 6. Heriot Watt / HW Tech Club President 
November 2018 - May 2021,  (Dubai , UAE)

My role as tech club president is to work on projects that seem to help towards building a strong community. 

#### Milestones acheived:
1. Grew the club from 8 to 160 members 
2. Setup the leadership team 
3. Lead the leadership to setup initial infrastructure 
4. Setup tech club to run using an open source model
5. Initial contributor to boost projects within the club  

<!-- ### Dubai Holiday Camps / Assistant Teacher 
July  2017 - July  2019,  DIA, Dubai

My role as an assistant teacher was to just make sure that kids have as much fun as possible by getting involved in various sports such as Football, Basketball , Tennis , Dodgeball etc... -->

#### Final Dissertation: [p2p network rendering/computation](/projects/p2prc/) 

### Heriot-Watt University / PhD Computer Science
January 2022 - Present

#### Keywords
- [CHERI](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/cheri/)
- Memory allocators
- FreeBSD kernel development

#### Languages used:
- C  
- ARM Assembly 

#### Ongoing research:
The increasing disparity between application workloads and the capacity of Translation Lookaside Buffers (TLB) has prompted researchers to explore innovative solutions to mitigate this gap. One such approach involves leveraging physically contiguous memory to optimize TLB utilization. Concurrently, advancements in hardware-level system security, exemplified by the Capability Hardware Enhanced RISC Instructions (CHERI) architecture, offer additional opportunities for improving memory management and security.
CHERI introduces capability-based addressing, a novel approach that enhances system security by associating capabilities with memory pointers. These capabilities restrict access to memory regions, thereby fortifying the system against various security threats. Importantly, the mechanisms implemented in CHERI for enforcing memory protection can also serve as accelerators for standard user-space memory allocators. By leveraging capability-based addressing, memory allocators can efficiently manage memory resources while ensuring robust security measures are in place.
