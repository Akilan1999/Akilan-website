## Hi there,
I am just a normal person.
I love to build stuff and a huge believer in randomization.
### Areas I focus on:
1. Distributed computation 
2. p2p networks 
3. RISC-V 
4. Linux distributions 
5. Compilers 

<!-- ### Preferred programming langauge to use:
- Go lang (Scalable code)  -->

### My wish list
- FS2020 becomes open source or better alternatives catch up.
- Distributed computing on the foundations of a p2p network becomes the standard norm.  
<!-- - Using houseold devices to generate basic income -->
